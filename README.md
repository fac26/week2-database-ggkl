## About

We created a community film database, allowing users to input a film via name, year, director, and a selection of genres. An id is created for each entry.

The database has the following structure:



| id  | name | year | director         | genre_id |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---------------- | -------- |
| 1   |Jaws  |1975  |Steven Spielberg  |  1       |
| 2   | Star Wars     |  1977    |George Lucas | 2 |
| 3   | The Empire Strikes Back | 1980 | Ivan Kershner | 2       |
